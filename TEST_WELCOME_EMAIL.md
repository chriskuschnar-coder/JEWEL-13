# Welcome Email System - Testing Guide

## Current Status

Your welcome email system is **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and ready to use. The code automatically sends welcome emails when new users sign up.

## Where SendGrid Credentials Should Be

SendGrid credentials need to be stored as **Supabase Edge Function Secrets** (not in local .env files).

### Required Secrets:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Your SendGrid API key
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` - Your verified sender email (e.g., welcome@globalmarketsconsulting.com)

## How to Check if Secrets Are Already Configured

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings** â†’ **Edge Functions**
4. Look for secrets named `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`

### Option 2: Test by Creating a New Account
1. Create a new test user account on your platform
2. Check the Supabase Edge Function logs:
   - Dashboard â†’ **Edge Functions** â†’ **Logs**
   - Look for the `send-welcome-email` function
   - If secrets are missing, you'll see: "SENDGRID_API_KEY not found"
   - If secrets are present, you'll see: "Welcome email sent successfully"

## If Secrets Are Already Configured

If you already have SendGrid secrets in Supabase, **the system is already working!**

Test it by:
1. Creating a new user account
2. Checking your email inbox
3. Verifying in the database that `users.welcome_email_sent = true`

## If Secrets Are NOT Configured

You need to add them to Supabase. You can do this via:

### Via Supabase CLI (if installed):
```bash
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="welcome@globalmarketsconsulting.com"
```

### Via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Edge Functions
2. Click "Add Secret"
3. Add both secrets listed above

## Where to Get SendGrid Credentials (if you don't have them)

If you need to create new SendGrid credentials:

1. **SendGrid Account**: https://sendgrid.com/free
2. **Get API Key**: Settings â†’ API Keys â†’ Create API Key
3. **Verify Sender**: Settings â†’ Sender Authentication â†’ Verify Single Sender

## What the Welcome Email Contains

The email automatically includes:
- âœ… Professional GMC logo and branding
- âœ… Personalized greeting with user's name
- âœ… "Account Created Successfully" confirmation
- âœ… Call-to-action button to sign in
- âœ… Next steps checklist (2FA, documents, KYC, funding)
- âœ… "Why Choose GMC" section (SEC registered, SIPC protected, etc.)
- âœ… Support contact information
- âœ… Professional footer with company details

## Automatic Triggering

The system automatically:
1. Triggers when a user signs up successfully
2. Creates user profile in database
3. Calls the `send-welcome-email` edge function
4. Sends beautiful HTML email via SendGrid
5. Marks `welcome_email_sent = true` in database
6. Prevents duplicate emails

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs for errors
- Verify SENDGRID_API_KEY is set correctly
- Ensure sender email is verified in SendGrid

### Email Going to Spam
- Verify your domain in SendGrid (not just single sender)
- Set up SPF and DKIM records
- Use a professional domain (not @gmail.com)

### Email Not Received
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Check SendGrid dashboard for delivery status

## Next Steps

1. Check if secrets are already configured in Supabase
2. If not, add them using dashboard or CLI
3. Test by creating a new account
4. Check inbox and edge function logs
5. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
