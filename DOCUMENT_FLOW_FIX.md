# âœ… Document Flow Fix - Managed Allocation

## ðŸ”§ Issue Fixed

**Problem:**
- DocumentSigningFlow was overlaying everything incorrectly
- Wasn't taking users through the proper document signing process
- Not using the same flow as self-managed portfolio section

**Solution:**
- Replaced `DocumentSigningFlow` with `AlgoStrategyDocumentFlow`
- Now uses the exact same component as self-managed algorithms
- Proper full-screen modal with sequential document signing

## ðŸ“„ Implementation Details

### Changes Made

**File: `ManagedAllocationOnboarding.tsx`**

1. **Import Change:**
```typescript
// OLD
import DocumentSigningFlow from '../DocumentSigningFlow'

// NEW
import AlgoStrategyDocumentFlow from './AlgoStrategyDocumentFlow'
```

2. **Modal Rendering:**
```typescript
// OLD
{showDocuments && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50">
    <DocumentSigningFlow
      onComplete={() => {...}}
      onBack={() => {...}}
    />
  </div>
)}

// NEW
{showDocuments && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-white">
    <AlgoStrategyDocumentFlow
      subscriptionType="managed_allocation"
      onComplete={() => {
        setShowDocuments(false)
        setDocumentsComplete(true)
      }}
      onBack={() => setShowDocuments(false)}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

## ðŸ”„ User Flow Comparison

### Self-Managed Portfolio
```
Algorithm Selection â†’ Documents (3 docs) â†’ KYC â†’ Funding â†’ Complete
```

### Managed Allocation (NOW FIXED)
```
Risk Assessment â†’ Goal â†’ Timeline â†’ Protection â†’ Strategy â†’
Documents (3 docs) â†’ KYC â†’ Funding â†’ Complete
```

**Both now use the exact same `AlgoStrategyDocumentFlow` component!**
