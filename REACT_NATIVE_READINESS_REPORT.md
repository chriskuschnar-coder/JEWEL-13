# React Native Migration Readiness Report
**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Project:** Global Markets Consulting Investment Platform
**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive Pre-Migration Audit

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Readiness Score: 62/100**

Your mobile web app demonstrates strong fundamentals with complete core features, but requires significant refactoring before React Native conversion. The application is production-ready as a PWA but needs strategic modifications for native mobile deployment.

### Key Findings
- ‚úÖ **Complete Feature Set**: All major flows (auth, KYC, trading, funding) are implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heavy Web Dependencies**: 75+ uses of browser-specific APIs (window, document, navigator)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI Library Limitations**: Radix UI not compatible with React Native
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Animation Complexity**: 64 files use Framer Motion (partial RN support)
- ‚úÖ **Strong Backend**: Supabase with 23 edge functions provides solid foundation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Persistence**: localStorage usage requires migration to AsyncStorage

---

## 10. Risk Assessment

### High Risks

1. **TradingView Charts** (Impact: HIGH, Probability: HIGH)
   - **Risk**: No direct replacement, may require custom solution
   - **Mitigation**: Budget 200+ hours for custom chart development
   - **Fallback**: Use simpler charts, delay advanced features

2. **Didit KYC Integration** (Impact: HIGH, Probability: MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: Iframe not supported, native SDK may not exist
   - **Mitigation**: Contact Didit early for native options
   - **Fallback**: Use WebView or switch KYC provider

3. **Performance on Low-End Devices** (Impact: MEDIUM, Probability: MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: Complex animations may lag
   - **Mitigation**: Test early on mid-range Android devices
   - **Fallback**: Simplify animations, reduce real-time updates

4. **App Store Rejection** (Impact: HIGH, Probability: LOW)
   - **Risk**: Financial app compliance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Follow guidelines strictly, legal review
   - **Fallback**: Address issues quickly, resubmit

### Medium Risks

5. **Third-Party API Rate Limits** (Impact: MEDIUM, Probability: MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: CoinGecko API may rate limit mobile app
   - **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching, request throttling
   - **Fallback**: Switch to paid API tier or alternative provider

6. **Push Notification Delivery** (Impact: MEDIUM, Probability: LOW)
   - **Risk**: iOS/Android may delay or drop notifications
   - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms, user preferences
   - **Fallback**: Use in-app polling as backup

## 12. Conclusion & Recommendations

### Summary
Your investment platform has a **solid foundation** but requires **significant refactoring** for React Native. The **62/100 readiness score** indicates a **5-month timeline** with a dedicated team.

### Key Recommendations

1. **Start with Expo (Managed Workflow)**
   - Faster development cycle
   - Built-in solutions for common needs
   - Easy to eject if needed later

2. **Prioritize Core Flows First**
   - Auth ‚Üí KYC ‚Üí Funding ‚Üí Portfolio ‚Üí Trading
   - Don't try to achieve feature parity immediately

3. **Replace TradingView Early**
   - This is the biggest technical challenge
   - Budget significant time for custom charts

4. **Invest in Performance Testing**
   - Test on real devices (especially mid-range Android)
   - Profile memory and CPU usage regularly

5. **Plan for Offline Mode**
   - Mobile users expect offline functionality
   - Cache portfolio data and transaction history

6. **Implement Analytics from Day 1**
   - Track user flows and drop-offs
   - Monitor crash rates and performance
   - Use Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics

7. **Consider Hybrid Approach**
   - Keep web app as primary platform
   - Use React Native for mobile-specific features
   - Share business logic between platforms

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
   - Review this report with team
   - Contact Didit about native KYC options
   - Evaluate TradingView alternatives
   - Create project timeline in Jira/Linear

2. **Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Set up React Native project
   - Install core dependencies
   - Create proof-of-concept for charts
   - Test Stripe native SDK integration

3. **Medium-term (Next Month)**
   - Begin Phase 1 implementation
   - Hire additional developers if needed
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Create design system in Figma
