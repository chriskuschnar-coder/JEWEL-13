# Testing Quick Reference Guide

## Running Automated Tests

### 1. Import and Run Tests
```typescript
import { featureTests } from './tests/automated-feature-tests'

// Run all tests
const results = await featureTests.runAllTests()

// Get summary
const summary = featureTests.getSummary()
console.log(`Pass Rate: ${summary.passRate.toFixed(2)}%`)
```

### 2. Run Individual Test Suites
```typescript
// Market data only
await featureTests.testMarketDataStreaming()

// Trade execution only
await featureTests.testTradeExecution()

// Portfolio calculations only
await featureTests.testPortfolioCalculations()
```

- Cached fallback during API downtime

#### Trade Execution
- All order types validated (Market, Limit, Stop)
- Invalid inputs properly rejected
- Leverage limits enforced (1-125x)
- Over-withdrawal protection
- Zero/negative size validation

#### Portfolio Calculations
- NAV calculation: ✅ Accurate to 0.01
- Unit price calculation: ✅ Accurate to 0.001
- PnL calculation: ✅ Correct
- Percent change: ✅ Correct
- Division by zero protected

#### Error Handling
- Network timeouts handled gracefully
- Invalid JSON caught and logged
- Null references use optional chaining
- Array bounds safe
- NaN detection and handling
